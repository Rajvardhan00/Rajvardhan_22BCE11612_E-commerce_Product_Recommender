    "## Overview\n",
    "A hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and content-based approaches with LLM-powered explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering\n",
    "- **LLM Explanations**: AI-generated reasoning for each recommendation\n",
    "- **REST API**: Flask-based backend for easy integration\n",
    "- **SQLite Database**: Persistent storage for products and user interactions\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**: Coverage, diversity, and rating analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask openai sqlalchemy matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the Jupyter notebook cells in order (1-11)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the API:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In notebook\n",
    "test_api_locally()\n",

    "## API Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET /` - API information\n",
    "- `GET /recommend/<user_id>?n=5&explain=true` - Get recommendations\n",
    "- `GET /product/<product_id>` - Get product details\n",
    "- `GET /user/<user_id>/history` - Get user history\n",
