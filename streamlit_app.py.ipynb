    "    ## 🎯 E-commerce Product Recommender System\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is a **hybrid recommendation system** that combines multiple AI techniques to provide personalized product suggestions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 🧠 Algorithms Used\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### 1. **Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "    - Analyzes user behavior patterns\n",
    "    - Finds similar users based on purchase history\n",
    "    - Recommends products liked by similar users\n",
    "    - **Strength:** Discovers unexpected connections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### 2. **Content-Based Filtering**\n",
    "    - Analyzes product attributes (category, description)\n",
    "    - Uses TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis\n",
    "    - Calculates product similarity using cosine similarity\n",
    "    - **Strength:** Provides consistent, explainable recommendations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### 3. **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)\n",
    "    - Combines both methods (60% collaborative, 40% content-based)\n",
    "    - Balances discovery and relevance\n",
    "    - **Strength:** Best overall performance\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 📊 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Coverage:** Percentage of catalog recommended\n",
    "    - **Diversity:** Variety of categories in recommendations\n",
    "    - **Quality:** Average rating of recommended products\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 🛠️ Technologies\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Backend:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn\n",
    "    - **Database:** SQLite\n",
    "    - **UI:** Streamlit\n",
    "    - **ML:** TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity\n",
    "    - **Visualization:** Plotly\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 📝 How to Use\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Select a user** from the sidebar (1-50)\n",
    "    2. **Choose recommendation method** (Hybrid recommended)\n",
    "    3. **Click \"Generate Recommendations\"**\n",
    "    4. **Explore** user profiles and system statistics\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 🎓 Created By\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This system was built as a demonstration of modern recommendation algorithms used by e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify.\n",
